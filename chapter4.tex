\chapter{Arquitectura}
\label{makereference4}

In this chapter, I want to refer to Chapter~\ref{makereference},
so I'm going to use the slash ref command along with the
"makereference" label which I assigned back at the beginning of
Chapter 1.

\section{arquitectura 1}
\label{makereference4.1} I should also be able to refer to a
specific page number, such as page~\pageref{makereference}.  Of
course, I'll need to have a slash label command and a unique name
in each section that I want to be able to refer to later in the
text.

\section{arquitectura 2}
\label{makereference4.2} Now, I'm going to refer to different
sections within Chapter 1. I gave an example of a figure in
section~\ref{makereference1.1} and an example of a table in
section~\ref{makereference1.2}.  In
section~\ref{makereference1.3}, we looked at examples of
bibliographic citations.
