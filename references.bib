	Note = {For Fig.~\ref{fig:chap02:Mathematica:DvsDetuning}, the following parameters were          used:  $I_{p} = 20$~W/cm$^{2}$, $I_{s}$ was set such that the Rabi frequencies, $\Omega_{p}$ and          $\Omega_{s}$ were equal, $w_{p} = w_{s} = 50$~ns and $\tau = -80$~ns.  Both $\Delta_{1}$ and          $\Delta_{2}$ (one- and two-photon resonance, respectively) were allowed to vary.}}
