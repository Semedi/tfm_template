{\bf \Huge Abstract}

  \end{center}
\vspace{1cm}

This work consist on the implementation of EPFIOT (Edge Provisioning For Internet of Things). An appliance developed to look at Infraestructure as a service based on the edge. It is specifically prepared for interact with IoT devices using special hardware accelerators designed for AI.

Cloud computing is the only choice nowadays, certain doubts arise about if it would be mandatory to keep all device data sended directly to cloud assuming the latency costs, Epfiot relies in using low specs hardware and try to bring to your local area network a similiar cloud model, simplifying the way of providing virtual machines using real hardware accelerators for your devices, allowing the device to perform inference over the collected data quickly.

The application has a graphql interface for building an entire IoT ecosystem, using infraestrucure on the edge thanks to linux virtualization (kvm) and emerging technologies like for example LwM2M to provide device bootstraping.
